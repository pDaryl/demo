use git pull command to get this file on my editor. i can also specify where from by doing git pull origin main. 

what i am doing now is making a change in the remote repo that i wont have on my main file in the editor.

by making a change on the remote repo and then making a change here. if i try to push my updates to the remote repo i will get an error. I have to remember that whatever is in the remote repo needs to match what is in my editor. so anything i change in my remote repo i have to first pull into here and then i can push the changes out.
